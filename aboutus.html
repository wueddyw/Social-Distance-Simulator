            <p>Our teams objective for this project was to present our audience with a fun, engaging pastime during the social distancing times of COVID 19. Our world these days has plenty of doom and gloom. Our team believes that it is important to keep things light, even during these scary times. This ideology is reflected well in our team culture. We consistently strive to enjoy our work, while also recognizing the gravity of the problems facing the world.</p>
